Dec 29:
- Starting code has been downloaded.
- main task for Dec 30 is as follows:
    - setup main board. Remember, the request is to have 7 cols and 7 rows
    - Top row of board is to be a link or button that users can click to add a blue/red circle to the board


planning:
HTML:
- setting div to reflect each row of the connect four area.
    -This was completed by adding table rows and columns. Top row was placed in a table head (th) to make things easier for me to understand and separate the actual board from the area that the players would be clicking on.
    - After top row was added, radius of the border was changed to 50% to make the element a circle representing a connect 4 dot.
- Top row is what controls where the dot will be added through an eventListener(click).
- JS needs to check which player is currently playing basedon the color of each circle (checking each class to see if it's red of blue).
    - POSSIBLE IDEA: toggle player class on and off to change the color of the dot added along with updating the matrix of the board to contain the same color name.
- COULD save game state to localStorage OR sessionStorage.
